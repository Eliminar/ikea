# IKEA Dataset for Interior Design

Dataset was collected from IKEA.com website for the purpose of Style Search engine.

It consists of :
* 2193 object (product) photos.
* 298 context (room scene) photos in which those objects appear.
* Text descriptions for products.
* Ground truth information on which items appear in which rooms.

We group together objects of the same category (chair, table, sofa, etc).
